My Bitburner scripts.

## Your what?

Bitburner is a programming-based incremental game where you can write scripts in JavaScript to automate gameplay, learn skills, play minigames, solve puzzles and more in a cyberpunk, text-based incremental RPG.

These are the scripts I'm currently using in the game.
